# AppiumGrid

Hi Guys, this is Chirag Singh and this repository contains all the code which I created on the You Tube Channel "FREE AUTOMATION LEARNING". You can download the code and run these code at your machine.

You can watch the appium grid video on https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXbcghgSZDrq7rUFsXoR-7idS4DFTOqKO

This repository contains the code to run test script parallel on the mobile devices and also run the code on the browser by using selenium webdriver.

To run the code on mobile you need to pass "myPlatform" as "mobile" and if you need to run the code web browser on the desktop then you need to pass "myPlatform" as "web" in the BaseClass.java file at line number 50.# HackathonFramework
